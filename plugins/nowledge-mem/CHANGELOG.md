# Changelog

## 0.6.3

### Live settings reload
- Settings changes (apiUrl, apiKey, recallPolicy, autoCapture, maxRecallResults) now take effect immediately via `settings.onDidChange()`
- No longer requires plugin reload or Alma restart after changing Access Anywhere credentials
- Client is recreated with fresh credentials when apiUrl/apiKey change

### Status diagnostics tool
- Add `nowledge_mem_status` tool for checking connection health and configuration
- Returns: connection mode (local/remote), API URL, API key configured (boolean), CLI availability, server connectivity, and current settings
- Useful for verifying Access Anywhere remote configuration is working correctly

### Plugin lifecycle compliance
- `activate()` now returns `{ dispose }` per Alma `PluginActivation` contract
- Tool and event registrations collect `Disposable` handles for proper cleanup
- Alma can now cleanly unregister all tools and events on plugin deactivation

## 0.6.1

### Access Anywhere (remote access)
- Add `apiUrl` and `apiKey` settings for connecting to a remote Mem instance
- API key is injected via environment variable only (never as CLI arg, never logged)
- URL is passed via `--api-url` CLI flag (safe, not a secret)
- Startup log now shows `mode=remote` or `mode=local`

## 0.6.0

### Thread provenance (sourceThreadId linkage)
- Memory search, show, and query results now include `sourceThreadId` when the memory was distilled from a conversation
- Enables progressive retrieval: find memory -> trace to source conversation -> read full messages

### Structured save with dedup guard
- `nowledge_mem_store` now supports `unit_type` (fact, preference, decision, plan, procedure, learning, context, event)
- Temporal fields: `event_start`, `event_end`, `temporal_context` for when events happened (not when saved)
- Save dedup check: blocks saves at >=90% similarity to existing memories, preventing duplicates
- Dedup is best-effort and never blocks saves on search failure

### Thread pagination
- `nowledge_mem_thread_show` now supports `offset` for progressive retrieval of long conversations
- Returns `totalMessages`, `hasMore`, `returnedMessages` for client-side pagination awareness
- CLI uses `--limit`/`--offset` (requires nmem-cli >=0.6)

### Thread source filter
- `nowledge_mem_thread_search` now accepts `source` parameter to filter by platform (e.g. 'alma', 'claude-code')
- CLI uses `--source` flag (requires nmem-cli >=0.6)

### Behavioral guidance
- Recall injection hook now includes proactive save nudge and sourceThreadId awareness
- Updated CLI playbook with new flags (`--unit-type`, `--source`, `--offset`, `--limit`)

### Improved tool descriptions
- All tool descriptions updated to mention sourceThreadId linkage and progressive retrieval patterns
- Store tool description encourages proactive saving with structured types

## 0.2.13

## 0.2.6

- Simplify configuration surface with single `nowledgeMem.recallPolicy` setting
- Keep runtime backward compatibility for legacy recall settings (`autoRecall`, `autoRecallMode`, `recallFrequency`)
- Add command-driven staged ingest flow (`Nowledge Mem: Search and Ingest`) for chat session context injection
- Add command to clear staged ingest per thread
- Continue including compact `nmem` CLI playbook in balanced recall mode for Bash fallback flows

## 0.2.5

- Add `nowledgeMem.recallFrequency` (`thread_once` / `every_message`) for controllable recall injection cadence
- Add `nowledgeMem.injectCliPlaybook` to include compact `nmem` fallback guidance in injected context
- Extend startup logging with effective recall policy details
- Update README policy matrix and examples for tool-hidden chat sessions

## 0.2.4

- Add explicit injected-context metadata in auto-recall block to reduce ambiguity vs live tool calls
- Add `nowledgeMem.autoRecallMode` setting with `balanced` and `strict-tools` policies
- In `strict-tools`, disable recall injection intentionally and log policy resolution at startup
- Improve configuration descriptions and add policy matrix/examples in README

## 0.2.3

## 0.2.2

- Normalize tool outputs to stable shapes (`ok/query/total/items` or `ok/item`)
- Add structured CLI error mapping (`nmem_not_found`, `not_found`, `permission_denied`, `cli_error`)

- Add update validation requiring at least one field change
- Add thread create validation requiring `content` or `messages`

## 0.2.1

- Add `nowledge_mem_query` one-shot tool to reduce ToolSearch-only loops
- Strengthen auto-recall instruction with fully-qualified tool ids (`nowledge-mem.*`)

## 0.2.0

- Add full on-demand memory tools: `show`, `update`, `delete` in addition to search/store
- Add on-demand thread tools: `thread_search`, `thread_show`, `thread_create`, `thread_delete`
